# Membrane Computing for the Identification of Attacks to Communication Networks 
Membrane System implementation, designed for identifying network intrusions using C++ and CUDA on GPUs for parallel computation.

## Overview
The code simulates a Cell-Like Membrane System, or P System, which is a computational model inspired by cellular biology. By organizing network nodes as membranes and data packets as objects, the model provides parallel processing capabilities suitable for tasks like intrusion detection and traffic monitoring.
